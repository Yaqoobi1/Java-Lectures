	// the default keyword is used when you have interfaces that you have been using
	// in a lot of classes
	// and now you need to add a new method to the interface
	// you can provide it with a default implementation using the default modifier
	
	

	// you can not create an object of the interfaces
	// you can achieve 100% abstraction with interfaces
	// you can not have implementation for your methods in an interface unless its
	// static or default
	// you can implement multiple interface in one class
	// you are basically overriding the methods when you are providing
	// implementation

	// Things to know
	// 1. what is abstraction
	// 2. differences between interfaces and abstract classes
	// 3. examples of use cases in your project
	// 4. syntaxes
